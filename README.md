I am a machine learning scientist at [Thomson Reuters
Labs](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/careers/our-jobs/join-thomson-reuters-labs.html),
working on machine learning models embedded as components of search systems,
including re-ranking, dense retrieval (a.k.a. vector search) and
retrieval-augmented generation with large language models (LLMs).

Previously I was a postdoctoral research associate at [Pacific Northwest
National Lab](https://www.pnnl.gov/), working in [Tegan
Emerson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sxRHY7MAAAAJ)'s Math of Data
Science group where my mentor was [Henry Kvinge](https://hkvinge.github.io/).
Before that I completed a PhD in mathematics (algebraic geometry) at the
University of Washington, advised by [S&aacute;ndor
Kov&aacute;cs](http://sites.math.washington.edu/~kovacs/current/index.html).
