I recently completed a PhD in math. My research focuses on birational geometry
and singularities. Particular interests include:

- singularities of pairs in positive and mixed characteristic
- dual complexes of snc varieties and of singularities
- singularities in positive characteristic defined via Frobenius
  (F-singularities)

I also have some educational background in data science, including data
visualization and machine learning.
